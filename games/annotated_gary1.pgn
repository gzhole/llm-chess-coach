7. Bh4 g5 8. Bxg5 hxg5 9. exf6 Qxf6
{ [COACH] PositionalError (IntermediateMove): The move of Qxf6 is a significant positional error. It sacrifices a piece for a dubious exchange, leading to a weakened pawn structure and a lack of control over the center. The engine's suggestion of cxd4 immediately addresses this weakness, initiating a more active and secure development plan that avoids the inherent vulnerabilities of the sacrificed pawn. }
