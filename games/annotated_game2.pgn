{ D50 Queen's Gambit Declined: Modern Variation } 4... dxc4 5. e4 c5 6. e5 h6
7. Bh4 g5 8. Bxg5 hxg5 9. exf6 Qxf6
{ Qxf6 is a very passive move for Black. It doesn't develop any pieces or create any immediate threats. It simply allows White to occupy the center and potentially launch a kingside attack. cxd4, on the other hand, is a direct and aggressive move that challenges White's control of the center and opens lines for Black's pieces, creating a more active and dynamic position. }
10. dxc5 Bxc5 11. Bxc4 Qxf2# { Black wins by checkmate. } 0-1
